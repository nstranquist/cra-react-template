### Nico's Create-React-App template

This template seeks to provide the boilerplate that I usually prefer to start with, packaged in a convenient template that works with the create-react-app cli tool.

### Usage:

Run `yarn setup` before running `yarn start` so that all dependencies can be installed

shortcut: `yarn setup && yarn start`
