### Nico's Create-React-App template

This template seeks to provide the boilerplate that I usually prefer to start with, packaged in a convenient template that works with the create-react-app cli tool.

### Usage:

1) Clone this repo or make your own template!

2) Run `npx create-react-app <your_app> --template file:./path/to/cra/template`

3) (If using my template) run:
`yarn setup && yarn start`  

After this, the new react app should open in a new window at http://localhost:3000
